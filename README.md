# Kinaxis

This version of the graph is virtually the same as the other, except from the fact it is using node modules only to get the web app up and running.

There are two custom modules in the node_modules folder. Add the other ones by doing:

>> npm install

That should take a while, expect about 130 dependencies or so.

Once that is done, serve the JSON resource via HTTP by doing:

>> grunt serve

Then run the build by doing:

>> grunt build
